# GraphQL API

All Wasmer services use the Wasmer GraphQL API to interact with and retrieve data.


<Callout type="info">
**Did you know...?** [wasmer.io](https://wasmer.io/), the [Wasmer CLI](/install) and [wasmer.sh](https://wasmer.sh/) are all interacting with Wasmer via the public Wasmer GraphQL API.

### What is GraphQL?

> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

If you want to learn more about GraphQL, please visit the official Website: [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org/)

The Wasmer GraphQL API \(and the GraphiQL IDE\) can be accessed here:

### [**registry.wasmer.io/graphql**](https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql)

## Examples

Let's see now a few things that we can do with it!

### Get a Package Version

We can do a POST to [https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql](https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql) with the the following as the `query` POST field:

```graphql
{
    getPackageVersion(name: "python") {
    version
    repository
    homepage
    distribution {
      downloadUrl
      size
    }
  }
}
```

Which should return something similar to:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "getPackageVersion": {
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "repository": "https://github.com/wapm-packages/python",
      "homepage": null,
      "distribution": {
        "downloadUrl": "https://registry-cdn.wasmer.io/packages/_/python/python-0.1.0.tar.gz",
        "size": 5097541
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get all Packages for a given Interface

If we want to search all the packages published that have certain interface \(for example, WASI\), we can do a POST to [https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql](https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql) with the the following as the `query` POST field:

```graphql
{
  getInterfaceVersion(name: "wasi", version: "latest") {
    interface {
      name
      description
    }
    packageVersions {
      edges {
        node {
          version
          package {
            name
          }
          distribution {
            downloadUrl
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which should return something similar to:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "getInterfaceVersion": {
      "interface": {
        "name": "wasi",
        "description": "The WebAssembly System Interface. WASI is a modular system interface for WebAssembly. Itâ€™s focused on security and portability."
      },
      "packageVersions": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "version": "0.1.0",
              "package": {
                "name": "_/python"
              },
              "distribution": {
                "downloadUrl": "https://registry-cdn.wasmer.io/packages/_/python/python-0.1.0.tar.gz"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "version": "0.0.2",
              "package": {
                "name": "JeremyLikness/wasi-ubasic"
              },
              "distribution": {
                "downloadUrl": "https://registry-cdn.wasmer.io/packages/JeremyLikness/wasi-ubasic/wasi-ubasic-0.0.2.tar.gz"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "version": "0.4.6",
              "package": {
                "name": "vshymanskyy/wasm3"
              },
              "distribution": {
                "downloadUrl": "https://registry-cdn.wasmer.io/packages/vshymanskyy/wasm3/wasm3-0.4.6.tar.gz"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Happy hacking! ðŸŽ‰**
