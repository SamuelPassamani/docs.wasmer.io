# Interacting with the Filesystem


The `@wasmer/sdk` package provides users with the ability to mount directories
inside a running WASIX instance. This allows both the WASIX instance and a
JavaScript user to communicate via a shared folder.

Let's say you're using the FFmpeg WebAssembly module to convert a video file
from one format to another. You will need to store your input file somewhere so
that the WASIX program can use it. This is where a shared `Directory` comes in.
You'll store your input file in the shared directory, and then the WASIX program
will be able to read it and process it. When the processing is done, the output
file can be written back to the shared directory so the JavaScript host can
access it.

## Instantiating a `Directory`

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
```

The `Directory` class is used to create a directory that can be mounted inside a
WASIX instance's file system. You can create as many `Directory` instances as
you want.

## Adding Files to a `Directory`

The `writeFile()` method creates a new file in the specified directory, setting
its content to the provided data. The first argument is the path of the file,
and the second argument is the content of the file.

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
await dir.writeFile("/file.txt", "Hello, World!");
```

<Callout type="info">
The content of the file may be a `string` or `Uint8Array`.
</Callout>

## Creating Sub-Directories

The `createDir` method is used to create a directory in the virtual file system.
The argument is the path of the directory.

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
await dir.createDir("/pictures");
```

Now you can place files in the directory you just created like this:

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

// reading an image file as a blob and converting it to an Uint8Array
const response = await fetch("https://example.com/image.png");
const blob = await response.blob();
const image = await blob.arrayBuffer();

const dir = new Directory();
await dir.createDir("/pictures");
await dir.writeFile("/pictures/image.png", new Uint8Array(image));
```

## Reading Files from a `Directory`

There are two ways to read files from a directory.

### 1. The `readFile` Method

The `readFile()` method will read the file's bytes back as a `Uint8Array`.

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
const bytes = await dir.readFile("/file.bin");
```

### 2. The `readTextFile` Method

The `readTextFile()` method will read a file from the `Directory` and parse it as
a UTF-8 string. The argument is the path of the file.

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
const text = await dir.readTextFile("/output.txt");
```

## Listing a Directory's Contents

The `readDir()` method is analogous to the `ls` command in Linux. The argument
is the path of the directory.

```typescript copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
await dir.createDir("/mydir");
await dir.writeFile("/mydir/file.txt", new Uint8Array());
await dir.createDir("/mydir/pictures");
await dir.writeFile("/mydir/pictures/image.png", new Uint8Array());
await dir.createDir("/mydir/videos");
await dir.writeFile("/mydir/videos/video.mp4", new Uint8Array());

const entries = await dir.readDir("/mydir");
console.log(entries);
```

The output of the above code will be:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "file.txt",
    "type": "file"
  },
  {
    "name": "pictures",
    "type": "directory"
  },
  {
    "name": "videos",
    "type": "directory"
  }
]
```

## Mounting a Directory

The primary way to use `Directory` is by mounting it in a Wasmer package or
WASIX instance.

Both `Command.run()` and `runWasix()` accept a `mount` option which accepts
a mapping from paths to the `Directory` that should be mounted to that path.

For example, this is how you can mount a `Directory` to `/app` and use the
`cat` command from `sharrattj/coreutils` to print its contents.

```typescript
import { Wasmer, Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
await dir.writeFile("/file.txt", "Hello, World!");

const pkg = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("sharrattj/coreutils");
const cat = pkg.commands["cat"];
const instance = await cat.run({
  args: ["/app/file.txt"],
  mount: { "/app": dir },
});
let output = await instance.wait();

console.log(output.stdout); // Hello, World!
```

The same can also be done for a WebAssembly module instantiated from the user
instead of the registry.

```typescript
import { runWasix, Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const python = await WebAssembly.compile(fs.readFileSync("./python.wasm"));

const instance = await runWasix(python, {
  program: "python",
  args: ["/app/main.py"],
  mount: {
    "/app": {
      "main.py": "print('Hello, World!')",
    },
  },
});
```

## `DirectoryInit` Shorthand

As a shortcut for initializing a `Directory` when all contents are known
up-front, you may provide the `new Directory()` constructor with a mapping from
file paths to their contents. The TypeScript type definitions use the
`DirectoryInit` type alias to represent this mapping.

```ts copy
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory({
  "/file.txt": "Hello, World!",
  "/path/to/nested/file.bin": new Uint8Array(),
});
```

<Callout type="info">
As well as a `Directory` instance, both `Command.run()` and `runWasix()` accept
the `DirectoryInit` shorthand when specifying mounts.

This is useful when you don't need to hang on to the `Directory` handle or
access the `Directory` while the WASIX instance is running.
</Callout>

## Removing Files and Directories from a `Directory`

The `removeFile` method is used to remove a file from the `Directory`. The
argument is the path of the file.

The `removeDir` method is used to remove a directory from the `Directory`. The
argument is the path of the directory.

```typescript
import { Directory } from "@wasmer/sdk";

const dir = new Directory();
await dir.createDir("/mydir");
await dir.writeFile("/mydir/file.txt", new Uint8Array());

await dir.removeFile("/mydir/file.txt");
await dir.removeDir("/mydir");
```

<Callout type="warning">
The `removeDir` method will only remove empty directories. If you want to
remove a directory that has files in it, then you'll have to remove the files
first. Its behavior is analogous to the `rmdir` command in Linux.
</Callout>

## Kitchen Sink

Here is a comprehensive example of the `Directory` API.

It includes:

- Creating an empty `Directory`
- Mounting directories inside the newly spawned `python` instance
- Using the `DirectoryInit` shorthand to simplify passing in the `/src/main.py`
- Reading back the generated `/out/version.txt`

```typescript copy
import { init, Directory, Wasmer } from "@wasmer/sdk";

// Initialize the Wasmer SDK
await init();

// Download the Python package
const python = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("python/python");

// The script to be executed
const script = `
import sys

with open("/out/version.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write(sys.version)
`;
// A shared directory where the output will be written
const out = new Directory();

// Running the Python script
const instance = await python.entrypoint!.run({
  args: ["/src/main.py"],
  mount: {
    "/out": out,
    "/src": {
      "main.py": script,
    }
  },
});
const output = await instance.wait();

if (!output.ok) {
  throw new Error(`Python failed with exit code ${output.code}: ${output.stderr}`);
}

// Read the version string back
const pythonVersion = await out.readTextFile("/version.txt");
console.log(pythonVersion) // 3.11.6 (main, Oct  2 2023, 13:45:54) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)]
```
