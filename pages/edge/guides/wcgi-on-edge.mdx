# CGI apps on Wasmer Edge

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a CGI app on Wasmer Edge. We will
be using the Rust's [CGI crate](https://crates.io/crates/cgi) to create a CGI app.

We'll just make a simple `Hello, World!` CGI app.

## What is CGI?

CGI or Common Gateway Interface is a standard for running programs on a web server
to generate dynamic content.
CGI programs are often written in scripting languages like Perl, Python, or Ruby,
but they can also be written in compiled languages like C, C++, or Rust.

### CGI with Wasmer

CGI works using the standard input and output streams. Wasmer maps the standard
input and output streams to the HTTP request and response. You can read more about WCGI
in our article, [Announcing WCGI](https://docs.wasmer.io/runtime/runners/wcgi).

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Creating a CGI app

<Steps>

<Install />

<Login />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Install the `wasm32-wasi` target:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

This will install the `wasm32-wasi` target for the Rust compiler.

### Initialize the project

We'll initialize an empty rust project using the `cargo` command-line tool.

```bash copy
cargo init --bin hello-cgi && cd hello-cgi
```

### Add the CGI crate

```bash copy
cargo add cgi
```

### Writing the CGI app

We'll write a simple CGI app that prints `Hello, World!` to the standard output.
This app also accepts a name as a body of the request and prints `Hello, {name}!`

> **Note:** This cgi app will be wired to WCGI and will be served on the root path.

```rust copy filename="src/main.rs"
use cgi::{http::StatusCode, Request, Response};

fn main() {
    cgi::handle(handler);
}

fn handler(request: Request) -> Response {
    let who = String::from_utf8_lossy(request.body());
    let who = if who.trim().is_empty() {
        "World"
    } else {
        who.trim()
    };

    cgi::text_response(StatusCode::OK, format!("Hello, {who}!"))
}

```


### Building the CGI app

As you see above in the source property, in the `module` section. We use the release build in wasm32-wasi target.

```bash copy
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
```

This will create a `hello-cgi.wasm` file in the `target/wasm32-wasi/release` directory.

### Wiring it up 

To run this `wcgi` app on wasmer, we first need to create a `wasmer.toml` configuration file.
Create a new file `wasmer.toml` at root level, and copy the following:

```toml copy filename="wasmer.toml"
[package]
name = "<your-namespace>/<your-package-name>" # 👈 Update this
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An application sample for WCGI"
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[[module]]
name = "server"
source = "target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-cgi.wasm"
abi = "wasi"

[[command]]
name = "server"
module = "server"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wcgi" # 👈 This is the runner we'll be using

[command.annotations.wcgi]
dialect = "rfc-3875" # This is the CGI dialect we'll be using
```


<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  <ol>
    <li>
      1. `your-namespace`: This is usually your username and also can be your organization name.
    </li>
    <li>
      2. `your-package-name`: This is the name of your package that'll be published to the wasmer-registry.
    </li>
  </ol>
</Callout>

Your project should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="hello-cgi" defaultOpen>
	<FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
  	  <FileTree.File name="main.rs" />
  	</FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


### Running the CGI app

Now we can test our CGI app locally using the `wasmer` command-line.

```bash copy
wasmer run .
```

The above command will start a local server on port `8000`.

To test the app, we can use `curl` to send a request to the server.

```bash copy
curl http://localhost:8000
```

The root path will return `Hello, World!` as we didn't specify any name in the body.

```console
Hello, World!
```

```bash copy
curl -X POST -d "Wasmer" http://localhost:8000
```

The above command will send a `POST` request with the body `Wasmer` to the server.

```bash
Hello, Wasmer!
```

### Deploying the CGI app

In order to deploy the app, all we need to do is to run:

```bash copy
wasmer deploy
```

This will tigger a wizard which sets up the remaining configuration needed, similar to this:
```bash
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · wasmer-user
✔ What should be the name of the app? · hello-cgi
A package manifest was found in path /tmp/tmp.bDul0Ng4o3/hello-cgi/wasmer.toml.
✔ Use it for the app? · yes
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: /tmp/tmp.bDul0Ng4o3/hello-cgi/.)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace wasmer-user on the registry
✔ Successfully tagged package wasmer-user/wcgi-hello@0.1.0
Deploying app hello-cgi (wasmer-user) to Wasmer Edge...

App hello-cgi (wasmer-user) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://hello-cgi-wasmer-user.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://2j6h5i7cpmj6.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-user/hello-cgi

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

Note how there's been a new file, `app.yaml` created.
This file configures how to deploy your app to Wasmer edge.

### Testing the deployed app

We can test the deployed app using `curl`.

```bash copy
curl https://hello-cgi-wasmer-user.wasmer.app
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
    The deployment URL follows the format `https://<app-name>-<app-owner>.wasmer.com`
</Callout>

```console
Hello, World!
```

Works as expected!
