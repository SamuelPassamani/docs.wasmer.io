# Quickstart guide for a Python application

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a Python application on Wasmer Edge, 
in particular a Python http server.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new Python HTTP server, and deploying it.

## Deploying a Python application

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Initialize the local directory 

With the CLI installed, let's create a new Python application! We begin 
creating a new empty directory - after that, we will need to run a single command. 

```bash
$ mkdir my-python-http-server 
$ cd my-python-http-server
$ wasmer deploy --template=python-http-server             
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · <you> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

The `wasmer deploy --template=python-http-server` command will prompt you for the following:

- **App owner**: This is the owner of the app. It can be your username
  or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you to
  choose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name
  of the current directory. 

The above command will do the following:

- Download the template from the registry 
- Deploy it to Wasmer Edge with the user-provided informations

Let's check it: 
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
{"message": "Python app is running with Wasmer!"}% 
```

### Update the app 
Your directory should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="main.py" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  <FileTree.File name="LICENSE" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
</FileTree>

To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `main.py` file 
in the `src` folder: 

```python copy filename="src/main.py"
import os
import json
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer


class CustomHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')
        self.end_headers()

        data = {
            "message": "wasmer/python-http-server is running on Python!", # <-- Notice the comma!
            "hello": "world" # <- New line
        }
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8'))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    host = os.environ.get('HOST', '127.0.0.1')

    # Get the PORT environment variable if it's present; otherwise, default to 8000
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 80))

    server = HTTPServer((host, port), CustomHandler)
    print(f"Starting server on http://{host}:{port}")
    server.serve_forever()
```

Let's re-deploy our Python HTTP server:

```shell
$ wasmer deploy
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

Let's try to cURL the server:

```shell copy
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
{"message": "Python app is running with Wasmer!", "hello": "world"}% 
```

### Testing your Python application locally

To run your Python application locally simply run 
```shell copy
$ wasmer run . --net --env PORT=9090
Starting server on http://127.0.0.1:9090
``````

This will start a local server on  `http://localhost:9090`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. 
</Callout>

Let's try to cURL the server:

```shell copy
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9090
{"message": "Python app is running with Wasmer!"}% 
```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Python HTTP server on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your Python HTTP server, simply modify the `main.py` file
> in the `src` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
