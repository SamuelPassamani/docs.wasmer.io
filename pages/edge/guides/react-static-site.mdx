# Starter guide for deploying a react app

In this guide, you'll learn the process of publishing a static site using react on Wasmer Edge.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Deploying a Static Site

### Step 3.1: Initialize the React Starter template

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  If you have already your react project with you, you can skip this step and
  follow the step 3.2.
</Callout>

Clone the starter template from GitHub and install the dependencies:

```shell copy
$ git clone https://github.com/wasmerio/edge-react-starter.git
$ cd edge-react-starter
$ pnpm install
```

### Step 3.2: Setup a current react project for Wasmer Edge

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  This step is for those who already have a react project with them. If you are
  starting from scratch, you can follow the step 3.1 to get a boilerplate react
  project with vite.
</Callout>

Run the commands below to initialize files for Wasmer Edge:

```shell copy
$ wasmer app create --type static-website
```

```bash
  Who should own this package?:
  > <your-username>
  What package do you want to use?:
  > Create new package # üëàüèº let's select this for this tutorial
    Use existing package
  What should the package be called?: react-edge-tutorial # üëàüèº You can choose any name you like
  What should be the name of the app?: <your-username>-react-edge-tutorial
  Would you like to publish the app now? yes
  Creating the app...
  Publishing package...
  [1/2] ‚¨ÜÔ∏è   Uploading...
  [2/2] üì¶  Publishing...
  Successfully published package `<your-username>/react-edge-tutorial@0.1.0`
  Deploying app <your-username>/<your-username>-react-edge-tutorial...

   ‚úÖ App <your-username>/<your-username>-react-edge-tutorial was successfully deployed!

  > App URL: https://<your-username>-react-edge-tutorial.wasmer.app
  > Versioned URL: https://x43izt2fk0n5.id.wasmer.app # üåê You can access our URL too
  > Admin dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/<your-username>/<your-username>-react-edge-tutorial

  Waiting for the app to become reachable...
  (You can safely exit now with CTRL-C)
```

The `wasmer app create --type static-site` command will prompt you for the following:

- **Package owner**: This is the owner of the package. It can be your username or an organization.
- **Package**: This is the package you want to use. You can either select an existing package or create a new one.
- **Package name**: This is the name of your package. It must be unique across all packages on your namespace.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. It must be unique across all apps on your namespace.
- **Publish**: This will publish the new package and app to the registry.

<Callout type="default" emoji="‚öôÔ∏è">
  As you see above in the last line of the output, the CLI will prompt you to
  publish the new package and app. We recommend publishing the package and app.
</Callout>

The above command will do the following:

- Create a Wasmer package config (`wasmer.toml`)
- Create a app config (`app.yaml`)
- Create a **public** directory that holds the website data

<Callout type="default" emoji="‚öôÔ∏è">
  As mentioned above, the default public directory is `public`. You **must**
  change this for a react project to `build` or `dist` or any suitable directory
  other than public because it might contain your static assets such as
  **favicon**. The starter project in step 3.1, is setup with vite so the build
  directory is automatically set to `dist`.
  <br /> For a react project you can do this by setting the `outDir` using the `-o`
  flag in the `build` script in `package.json`:
>
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build -o dist" // üëàüèº dist or any other directory (keep consistent with wasmer.toml)
  }
  ```
</Callout>

After this you would have to change your `wasmer.toml` to match your project's build directory:

```toml copy filename="wasmer.toml"
[package]
name = "<your-wasmer-username>/<your-app-name>"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Your cool react project's description"

[dependencies]
"sharrattj/static-web-server" = "1"

[fs]
public = "dist" # üëàüèº dist or any other directory (keep consistent with package.json)
```

### Step 4: Test Your Site Locally

You can now test your site locally by running the following command:

```shell copy
$ wasmer run . --net -- --port 9000
```

This will start a local server using the Static Web Server on `http://localhost:9000` and now you can access your site on the web at the URL provided in the output.

<StaticSite image={edgeReactImg} />

You can also specify a different port by changing the `--port` flag.

> The arguments after `--` are passed to the static web server.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. To see all the avilable
  options for the static web server, run `wasmer run . -- --help`.
</Callout>

### Step 6: Deploy Your Site

To deploy your site just build your site and run the following command:

```shell copy
$ pnpm run build
```

Run the following command to deploy your site:

### Deploy Your Site

Once you have added all the necessary files to the public directory, it's time to update site.

Run the following command to deploy your site:

```shell copy
wasmer deploy
```

```shell
Loaded app from: /path/to/your/directory/app.yaml

Publish new version of package '<your-username>/react-edge-tutorial'? yes
Publishing package...

 ‚úÖ App <your-username>-react-edge-tutorial was successfully deployed!

.

```

> You can checkout our versioned URL above to access how our starter demo looks like.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You must be in the directory holding the `wasmer.toml` and `app.yaml` config
  files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  `wasmer deploy` automatically publishes your package and bumps the minor
  version. You can check all the available options with `wasmer deploy --help`
  or click [here](/edge/cli) to see the full documentation.
</Callout>

Executing this command will package and deploy your site.

Now you can access your site on the web at the URL provided in the output.

<Callout type="default" emoji="‚ô∫">
  To make changes to your site, simply modify the files in the public directory
  and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your react project on wasmer edge .
