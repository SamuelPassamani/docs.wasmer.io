# Using Wasmer Edge as a CDN

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Wasmer Edge as a CDN to host your static assets. We'll be using the [`static-web-server`](https://wasmer.io/wasmer/static-web-server)

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Deploying a Static Site

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

<Login />

### Initialize the project

We'll initialize the project with the `static-site` template.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:

```bash
$ wasmer app create
```

The above command will give you the following prompt:

```bash
App type:
> Static website # Select Static website
  HTTP server
  Browser shell
  JS Worker (experimental)
  Python Application
Who should own this package?: <your-namespace>
No package found or specified.
What should the package be called? It will be published under wasmer: <your-app-name> # This will be the package name of your CDN
What should be the name of the app? <NAME>.wasmer.app: <your-app-name> # This will be the name of your app
Would you like to publish the app now? no # Select no for now
Writing app config to '/path/to/your/project/app.yaml'
To (re)deploy your app, run 'wasmer deploy'
```

Select the above configuration mentioned in the comments and press enter.

The above command will initialize a blank project with the following structure.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="your-top-level-dir" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Changing configuration for the CDN

As you might notice, this project uses the `static-web-server` package which is a static web server written in Rust.

Most notably, it supports changing the compression level, cache control, cors, and more.
All these configurations can be super useful when configuring a CDN.

So, let's add a `config.toml` file in your top level directory for `static-web-server`'s configuration.

```toml
[general]

#### Address & Root dir
host = "::"
port = 8080
root = "/app/public" # üëàüèº Change the root directory to the public directory for static assets
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  The above configuration is the default configuration of the
  `static-web-server` package. More info about it can be found
  [here](https://static-web-server.net/configuration/config-file/).
</Callout>

Now, let's add the following configuration to the `wasmer.toml` file.

```yaml
[package]
name = "<your-namespace>/<your-app-name>"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "<your-namespace>/<your-app-name> CDN on Wasmer Edge"

[dependencies]
"wasmer/static-web-server" = "^1"

[fs]
"/app" = "." # üëàüèº Add the app directory as a volume mapping it to the root directory

[[command]]
name = "script"
module = "wasmer/static-web-server:webserver"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"

[command.annotations.wasi] # üëàüèº Add config.toml as an argument for the webserver
main-args = ["-w", "/app/config.toml"]
```

### Adding files for hosting

By default the static website template generates a `public/index.html`, we can remove it if we don't need it (`rm public/index.html`).

And now, let's add some images in our `public` directory to host. I'll be using some free images from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

This is how the directory structure looks like now:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="your-top-level-dir" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="image1.jpg" />
      <FileTree.File name="image2.jpg" />
      <FileTree.File name="image3.jpg" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

You can also add other files like css, js, videos, pdfs, etc.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  Maximum size of all the files combined should not exceed 500MB.
</Callout>

### Deploying the app

Now, let's deploy the app.

```bash
$ wasmer deploy
```

The above command will prompt you with the following:

```bash
Loaded app from: /path/to/your/dir/app.yaml

Publish new version of package '<your-namespace>/<your-app-name>'? yes
Publishing package...
[1/2] ‚¨ÜÔ∏è   Uploading...
[2/2] üì¶  Publishing...
Successfully published package `<your-namespace>/<your-app-name>@0.1.0`
Waiting for package to become available.....
Package '<your-namespace>/<your-app-name>@0.1.0' published successfully!

Deploying app <your-namespace>-<your-app-name>...

 ‚úÖ App <your-namespace>/<your-namespace>-<your-app-name> was successfully deployed!

> App URL: https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app
> Versioned URL: https://rogh5izceeq4.id.wasmer.app
> Admin dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-edge-as-cdn

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
New version is now reachable at https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app
Deployment complete
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  And now you can view your Static files at the URL mentioned above. You can
  also view the admin dashboard of your CDN by visiting the URL mentioned above.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="üåê">
  You'll need to do `wasmer deploy` again if you add any new files to the
  `public` directory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="üöß">
  The url of your project will be different from the one mentioned above.
</Callout>

### Accessing the files

You can access the files by visiting the URL of your project, followed by the file name.

For example, if you want to access the `image1.jpg` file, you can visit the following URL:

```bash
https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app/image1.jpg
```

The same goes for other files as well.

```bash
https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app/image2.jpg
https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app/image3.jpg
```

</Steps>
