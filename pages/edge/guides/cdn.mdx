# Using Wasmer Edge as a CDN

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Wasmer Edge as a CDN to host your static assets. We'll be using the [`static-web-server`](https://wasmer.io/wasmer/static-web-server)

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Deploying a Static Site

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

<Login />

### Initialize the project

We'll initialize the project with the `static-site` template.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:

```bash copy
wasmer app create
```

The above command will give you the following prompt:

```bash
✔ Who should own this app? · wasmer-user
✔ What should be the name of the app? · static-website
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Start with a template
✔ Select a language (6 available) · N/A
✔ Selected template · CDN Starter - demo url https://cdn-wasmer-starter.wasmer.app/
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · no
```
The prompt may vary depending depending on wasmer runtime version, **look for the CDN starter**.

The above command will initialize a project with the following structure.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="your-top-level-dir" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="image1.jpg" />
      <FileTree.File name="image2.jpg" />
      <FileTree.File name="image3.jpg" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="settings" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="config.toml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="LICENSE" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

You can also add other files like css, js, videos, pdfs, etc.

  Maximum size of all the files combined should not exceed 500MB.
</Callout>

### Deploying the app

Now, let's deploy the app.

```bash copy
wasmer deploy
```

The above command will prompt you with the following:

```bash
Loading local package (manifest path: /tmp/tmp.61AOVENLwX/.)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace wasmer-user on the registry
Deploying app static-website (wasmer-user) to Wasmer Edge...

App static-website (wasmer-user) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://static-website-wasmer-user.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://rogh5izc8j9o.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-user/static-website

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

And it's done!
The files you've put into the `./public` directory is now accessible from anywhere, at blazing fast speeds!

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  And now you can view your Static files at the URL mentioned in the deployment output.
  You can also view the admin dashboard of your CDN by visiting the URL mentioned in the deployment output.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="🌐">
  You'll need to do `wasmer deploy` again if you add any new files to the `public` directory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
    The deployment URL follows the format `https://<app-name>-<app-owner>.wasmer.app`
</Callout>

### Accessing the files

You can access the files by visiting the URL of your project, followed by the file name.

For example, if you want to access the `image1.jpg` file, you can visit the following URL:

```bash
https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app/image1.jpg
```

The same goes for other files as well.

```bash
https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app/image2.jpg
https://wasmer-edge-as-cdn.wasmer.app/image3.jpg
```


### Magic..! 🧙 How does it work?

Have a look inside your local `wasmer.toml` file, here you'll find how the CDN is setup: 
```toml filename="wasmer.toml"
[dependencies]
"wasmer/static-web-server" = "^1"

[fs]
"/public" = "public" # <-- Here the CDN files are being copied
"/settings" = "settings"

[[command]]
name = "script"
module = "wasmer/static-web-server:webserver" # <-- Here the module to run is being selected
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"

[command.annotations.wasi]
main-args = ["-w", "/settings/config.toml"] # <-- Here the static webserver is being configured
```

> Aha..! But a static webserver isn't a CDN..!

Wasmer Edge has dynamically distributed workers globally with replicated state.
This in combination with a fast and efficient webserver will serve data all over the world at minimal latency.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use Wasmer Edge as a CDN using the `static-web-server` package for hosting your static assets.
