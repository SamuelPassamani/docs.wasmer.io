# Quickstart guide for a static website

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a static site on Wasmer Edge.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new static site, and deploying it.

<Callout type="default" emoji="⚛">
  If you want to deploy a static site made from frameworks like React, Vue, or
  Svelte, you can follow our [React Static
  Site](/edge/guides/react-static-site) tutorial.
</Callout>

## Deploying a static site

<Steps>

<Install />

<Login />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Deploy!
We begin creating a new empty directory.
```bash copy
mkdir my-new-site
cd my-new-site
```

Then, running a single command, we can setup a static website.
```bash copy
wasmer deploy --template=static-website             
```

Expect to see output similar to this:
```bash
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · wasmer-user
✔ What should be the name of the app? · my-new-site
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: ~/wasmer-user/Projects/my-new-site/.)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace wasmer-user on the registry
Deploying app my-new-site (wasmer-user) to Wasmer Edge...

App my-new-site (wasmer-user) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://my-new-site-wasmer-user.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://2dyh6i3cvx1y.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-user/my-new-site

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
 ```

The above command will do the following:

1. Download the template from the registry 
1. Store the template locally in your current directory (try running `ls -la`)
1. Deploy it to Wasmer Edge

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
Don't change the `public` directory attribute in the `wasmer.toml` file for this tutorial.
If you want to learn how to specify a different directory for build output, check out our [React Static Site](/edge/guides/react-static-site) tutorial.
</Callout>

Try clicking the URL which is under the deployment message `https://my-new-site-wasmer-user.wasmer.app`, and expect to see something like:

<StaticSite image={staticSiteImg} />

### Update the app 
To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.html` file in the `public` folder: 

Your directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-new-site" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="LICENSE" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
	<FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
  	  <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
  	</FileTree.Folder>
  	<FileTree.Folder name="settings" defaultOpen>
  	  <FileTree.File name="config.toml" />
  	</FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Lets modify index.html:

```bash copy
sed -i -e 's/Hi from the Edge/This is our new title!/g' public/index.html 
```

Now, let's redeploy it:
```bash copy
wasmer deploy
```

When refreshing the browser, expect the page to have been updated:
<StaticSite image={updatedStaticSiteImg} />

### Add your content

Currently, the public directory only contains a basic `index.html` file.

You can now modify this directory and copy your own files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc) as needed.

### Test your site locally 

You can also test your site locally before deploying the app on Wasmer Edge by running the following command:

```shell copy
wasmer run .
```

This will start a local server using the Static Web Server on `http://localhost:8080`.
You can also specify a different port by passing the `--port` flag, as in `wasmer run . -- --port=<your-port>`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The arguments after `--` (double dash) are passed to the underlying server running in the Wasmer runtime.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation.
  To see all the avilable options for the static web server, run `wasmer run . -- --help`.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a static site on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your site, simply modify the files in the public
> directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
