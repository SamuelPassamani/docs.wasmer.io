# Quickstart guide for a Rust HTTP server 

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn how to deploy an HTTP server on the Wasmer Edge.
We will be using Rust's popular [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework to create a simple HTTP server.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Wasmer CLI](/install)
- [`WASIX`](http://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/rust/installation)

## Deploying an HTTP Server

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Initialize the local directory 

With the CLI installed, let's create a new Axum application! We begin 
creating a new empty directory - after that, we will need to run a single command. 

```bash
$ mkdir my-axum-server
$ cd my-axum-server
$ wasmer deploy --template=axum-starter
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
‚úî Who should own this app? ¬∑ <you> 
‚úî What should be the name of the app? ¬∑ <your-app-name> 

‚úî Unpacked template

NOTE: The selected template has a `BUILD.md` file.
This means there are likely additional build 
steps that you need to perform before deploying
the app:
 
# Building the application
1. Install [WASIX](https://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/rust/installation)
2. Build the application: `cargo wasix build --release`

After taking the necessary steps to build your application, re-run `wasmer deploy`
```

You can see, as prompted by the command, that we'll need a couple more steps
before deploying the server, namely actually _building_ the application: we
assume you installed the [`WASIX`](https://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/rust/installation) toolchain. We need to build the HTTP server
using `cargo wasix`:

```
$ cargo wasix build --release
...
Compiling wasmer-hello v0.1.0 (/.../Wasmer/edge-quickstart/wasmer-hello)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 10.69s
info: Post-processing WebAssembly files
```

<Callout type="default" emoji="üö®">
  It might happen that your build fails. This is due to different libraries
  that needs to be used to achieve WASIX compatibility: one of the easiest
  "gotchas" is forgetting to update your lock file with `cargo update`.
</Callout>

Now, Your directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="wasmer-hello" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="main.rs" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="target">
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="LICENSE" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="BUILD.md" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Once the application itself was correctly built, you can re-run `wasmer deploy`:
```shell
$ wasmer deploy 
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
‚úî Who should own this app? ¬∑ <you> 
‚úî What should be the name of the app? ¬∑ <your-app-name> 
‚úî Unpacked template
‚úî Do you want to deploy the app now? ¬∑ yes
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
‚úî Correctly built package locally
‚úî Package correctly uploaded
‚úî Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed üöÄ
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

‚Üí Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
‚Üí Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
ñ•î Deployment complete

```

Let's check it:
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
Hello, Axum ‚ù§Ô∏è WASIX!
```

### Test the server locally

We can test out server locally by running the following command:

import TerminalLeft from "@components/deploy/quickstart/TerminalLeft.mdx";
import TerminalRight from "@components/deploy/quickstart/TerminalRight.mdx";

| Terminal 1       | Terminal 2        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| <TerminalLeft /> | <TerminalRight /> |

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed an Axum server on Wasmer Edge üöÄ.

> Tip: To make changes to your Axum server, simply modify the `main.rs` file
> in the `app` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
