# Quickstart guide for a JS service worker

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a JS service
worker on Wasmer Edge. We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new
Javascript worker, and deploying it.

## Deploying a JS service worker

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Initialize the local directory 
With the CLI installed, let's create a new JS service worker! We begin 
creating a new empty directory - after that, we will need to run a single command. 

```bash
$ mkdir my-js-worker 
$ cd my-js-worker
$ wasmer deploy --template=js-worker
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
âœ” Who should own this app? Â· <you> 
âœ” What should be the name of the app? Â· <your-app-name> 
âœ” Unpacked template
âœ” Do you want to deploy the app now? Â· yes
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
âœ” Correctly built package locally
âœ” Package correctly uploaded
âœ” Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed ðŸš€
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

â†’ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
â†’ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
ð–¥” Deployment complete
```

The `wasmer deploy --template=js-worker` command will prompt you for the following:

- **App owner**: This is the owner of the app. It can be your username
  or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you to
  choose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name
  of the current directory. 

The above command will do the following:

- Download the template from the registry 
- Deploy it to Wasmer Edge with the user-provided informations

Let's check it: 
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
{"success":true,"package":"wasmer/js-worker-starter"}%   
```

### Update the app 
Your directory should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
</FileTree>

To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.js` file 
in the `public` folder: 

```js copy filename="src/index.js"
async function handler(request) {
  const out = JSON.stringify({
	hello: "world", 	// <- New line 
    success: true,
    package: "wasmer/js-worker-starter",
  });
  return new Response(out, {
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  });
}

addEventListener("fetch", (fetchEvent) => {
  fetchEvent.respondWith(handler(fetchEvent.request));
});
```

Now, simply run `wasmer deploy` again:
```shell
$ wasmer deploy
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
âœ” Correctly built package locally
âœ” Package correctly uploaded
âœ” Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed ðŸš€
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

â†’ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
â†’ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
ð–¥” Deployment complete
```

Let's check it again:
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
{"hello": "world", "success":true,"package":"wasmer/js-worker-starter"}%   
```

### Testing your JS service worker locally

To run your worker locally, simply run

```shell copy
$ wasmer run . --net
2023-10-05T09:46:19.513568Z  INFO wasmer_winter: starting webserver
2023-10-05T09:46:19.514089Z  INFO wasmer_winter::server: starting server on 0.0.0.0:8080 listen=0.0.0.0:8080
```

The above command will start a web server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Let's try to cURL the server:

```shell copy
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
{"success":true,"package":"wasmer/js-service-worker"}
```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a JS service worker on Wasmer Edge ðŸš€.

> Tip: To make changes to your JS service worker, simply modify the `index.js` file in the
> `src` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
