# Quickstart guide for a PHP application

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a PHPapplication on Wasmer Edge.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new PHP application, and deploying it.

## Deploying a PHP application 

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Initialize the local directory 

With the CLI installed, let's create a new PHP application! We begin 
creating a new empty directory - after that, we will need to run a single command. 

```bash
$ mkdir my-php-application && cd my-php-application
$ wasmer deploy --template=php-starter
```

The `wasmer deploy --template=php-starter` command will prompt you for the following:

- Download the PHP template from the registry 
- Deploy it to Wasmer Edge with the user-provided informations
  - **App owner**: This is the owner of the app. It can be your username
    or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you to
    choose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
  - **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name
    of the current directory. 

Let's check it: 
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app>.wasmer.app
1	=>	PHP code tester Sandbox Online
emoji	=>	😀 😃 😄 😁 😆
2	=>	5
5	=>	89009
Random number	=>	<random!>
PHP Version	=>	8.3.4
```


Your directory should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.php" />
    <FileTree.File name="info.php" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
</FileTree>

### Custom PHP settings 

PHP in Wasmer Edge is using the PHP development CLI, so we can assure maximum compatibility.
Because of that, we want to showcase how you can make your app ready for production workloads.

#### `scaling.mode` in `app.yaml`

If you check the `app.yaml` file, you will see the setting [`scaling.mode`](https://github.com/wasmer-examples/php-wasmer-starter/blob/main/app.yaml#L5-L6):

```yaml copy /single_concurrency/
scaling:
  mode: single_concurrency
```

`scaling.mode: single_concurrency` specifies to Wasmer Edge that each command only has one worker per thread, so Wasmer Edge can scale them accordingly. See [`scaling.mode` docs](/edge/configuration#scalingmode).

#### `php.ini` settings.

You can customize the PHP settings with a custom `php.ini`.
Create a `config/php.ini` inside of your folder, and use the following settings:

```ini filename="config/php.ini" copy
opcache.validate_timestamps = 0
opcache.file_update_protection = 0
opcache.max_file_size = 0

upload_max_filesize = "20M"
post_max_size = "25M"
```

Now, mount the `config` directoy inside of the filesystem (`fs`) in `wasmer.toml`, and set the
environment variable `PHPRC`

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" /config/ /PHPRC/
[fs]
# ...
"/config" = "config"

[[command]]
name = "run"
module = "php/php:php"
runner = "wasi"

[command.annotations.wasi]
main-args = ["-t", "/app", "-S", "localhost:8080"]
env = ["PHPRC=/config/"] # this indicates PHP where to look for php.ini
```

<Callout type="info">
The `main-args` current values are equivalent to calling `php -t app -S localhost:8080` in your local console.
</Callout>

#### Instaboot

If you want to accelerate the cold-start times of your PHP app (for example, if you are using Symfony or Laravel with tons of PHP imports), Instaboot can help to
speed up cold-starts by 100-200x.

```yaml filename="app.yaml"
capabilities:
  instaboot:
    # We provide a list of HTTP requests that will be used to pre-warm the
    # application.
    requests:
      # Load the homepage
      - path: /
```

Learn more about Instaboot [in our docs](/edge/learn/instaboot).


### Update the app 

To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.php` file 
in the `app` folder: 

```php copy filename="app/index.php"
<?php 
  echo 'Hello World!';   
  var_dump($_SERVER); 
?>
```

Now, simply run `wasmer deploy` again:

```shell
$ wasmer deploy
[...]
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

Let's check it again:
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app>.wasmer.app
Hello World! <more text..>
```

### Testing your PHP application locally
To test your PHP application locally simply run

```shell copy
$ wasmer run .
Starting server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
````

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. 
</Callout>


Let's try to cURL the server:

```shell copy
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000
1	=>	PHP code tester Sandbox Online
emoji	=>	😀 😃 😄 😁 😆
2	=>	5
5	=>	89009
Random number	=>	286
PHP Version	=>	8.3.4
Hello	=>	World
```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a PHP application on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your PHP application, simply modify the `index.php` file
> in the `app` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
