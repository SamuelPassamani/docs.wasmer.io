# Quickstart guide for a PHP application

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a PHPapplication on Wasmer Edge.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new PHP application, and deploying it.

## Deploying a PHP application 

<Steps>

<Install />

<Login />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Deploy!

We begin creating a new empty directory.
```bash copy
mkdir my-new-php-app
cd my-new-php-app
```

Then, running a single command, we can setup a php application.
```bash copy
wasmer deploy --template=php-starter
```

This will prompt you for the following:

- **App owner**: This is the owner of the app.
It can be your username or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you tochoose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name of the current directory. 

Expect to see output similar to this:
```bash
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · wasmer-user
✔ What should be the name of the app? · php-starter
✔ Select the directory to save the app in · php-starter
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: php-starter/.)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace wasmer-user on the registry
Deploying app php-starter (wasmer-user) to Wasmer Edge...

App php-starter (wasmer-user) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://php-starter-wasmer-user.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://2e5h6i7cd9ql.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-user/php-starter

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

Your directory should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.php" />
    <FileTree.File name="info.php" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
</FileTree>

Let's check it: 
```bash copy
curl https://php-starter-wasmer-user.wasmer.app
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
    The deployment URL follows the format `https://<app-name>-<app-owner>.wasmer.app`
</Callout>

Expect output similar to this:
```bash
1       =>      PHP code tester Sandbox Online
emoji   =>      😀 😃 😄 😁 😆
2       =>      5
5       =>      89009
Random number   =>      630
PHP Version     =>      8.3.4
```

### Update the app 

To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.php` file 
in the `app` folder: 

```php copy filename="app/index.php"
<?php 
  echo 'Hello World!';   
  var_dump($_SERVER); 
?>
```

Now, simply run `wasmer deploy` again:

```bash copy
wasmer deploy
```

Let's check it again:
```bash copy
curl https://php-starter-wasmer-user.wasmer.app
```

Expect to see:
```bash
Hello World!array(19) {
  ...
}
```


### Testing your PHP application locally
To test your PHP application locally simply run

```bash copy
wasmer run .
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. 
</Callout>


Let's try to cURL the server:

```bash copy
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Expect to see:
```bash
Hello World!array(19) {
  ...
}
```

### Custom PHP settings 

PHP in Wasmer Edge is using the PHP development CLI, so we can assure maximum compatibility.
Because of that, we want to showcase how you can make your app ready for production workloads.

#### `scaling.mode` in `app.yaml`

If you check the `app.yaml` file, you will see the setting [`scaling.mode`](https://github.com/wasmer-examples/php-wasmer-starter/blob/main/app.yaml#L5-L6):

```yaml copy /single_concurrency/
scaling:
  mode: single_concurrency
```

`scaling.mode: single_concurrency` specifies to Wasmer Edge that each command only has one worker per thread, so Wasmer Edge can scale them accordingly. See [`scaling.mode` docs](/edge/configuration#scalingmode).

#### `php.ini` settings.

You can customize the PHP settings with a custom `php.ini`.
Create a `config/php.ini` inside of your folder, and use the following settings:

```ini filename="config/php.ini" copy
opcache.validate_timestamps = 0
opcache.file_update_protection = 0
opcache.max_file_size = 0

upload_max_filesize = "20M"
post_max_size = "25M"
```

Now, copy the `config` directory inside of the filesystem (`fs`) in `wasmer.toml`, and set the environment variable `PHPRC`

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" /config/ /PHPRC/
[fs]
# ...
"/config" = "config"

[[command]]
name = "run"
module = "php/php:php"
runner = "wasi"

[command.annotations.wasi]
main-args = ["-t", "/app", "-S", "localhost:8080"]
env = ["PHPRC=/config/"] # this indicates PHP where to look for php.ini
```

<Callout type="info">
The `main-args` current values are equivalent to calling `php -t app -S localhost:8080` in your local console.
</Callout>

#### Instaboot

If you want to accelerate the cold-start times of your PHP app (for example, if you are using Symfony or Laravel with tons of PHP imports), Instaboot can help to
speed up cold-starts by 100-200x.

```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
capabilities:
  instaboot:
    # We provide a list of HTTP requests that will be used to pre-warm the
    # application.
    requests:
      # Load the homepage
      - path: /
```

Learn more about Instaboot [in our docs](/edge/learn/instaboot).



</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a PHP application on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your PHP application, simply modify the `index.php` file
> in the `app` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
