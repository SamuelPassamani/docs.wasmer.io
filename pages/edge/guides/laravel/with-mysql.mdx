For data store, why not start with a relational database classic: MySQL.

You can set up a MySQL-compatible serverless database:
* PlanetScale (Vitess)
* TiDB Cloud - https://tidbcloud.com/


## Laravel with MySQL-compatible PlanetScale

For a basic PlanetScale and Wasmer Edge connection, follow [our guide here](/edge/integrations/planetscale).

Once you're setup with PlanetScale, connect your Laravel application in Wasmer Edge through the following steps below:

1. Get Laravel connection information from PlanetScale instance
2. Connect from Laravel application in Wasmer Edge.

Once initialized, your database dashboard should have metrics and options like so:

1. Click on the Connect button at the top right, this should provide a box of information for connecting with your PlanetScale database.
2. First though, make sure to add a password, by clicking on the “New Password” button at the upper right corner. This should show you a new password afterwards.
3. Next, select “Laravel” in the list labeled “Connect with”

Take note of the connection string provided and let’s move on!


## Laravel with MySQL-compatible TiDB

You can also use TiDB in Wasmer Edge. TiDB is mostly MySQL-compatible (although it has some minor incompatiblities).
