# Wasmer Edge vs Amazon Lambda

Wasmer Edge and Amazon Lambda are both serverless platforms for running services at scale.

### Similarities

Wasmer Edge and Amazon Lambda share these similarities:

- **Fast startup times**
- **Infinitely scalable**
- Both can run as **idempotent** functions (e.g. [_WCGI_](/runtime/runners/wcgi))

### Differentiators

Wasmer Edge and Amazon Lambda differ in significant ways:

- Wasmer Edge is **more afforable** than Lambda
- Wasmer Edge is built on **simpler and more scalable** technology than Lambda (which is built on top of Firecracker)
- Wasmer Edge **doesn't require code changes in your application** to run, while you need to adapt your code to use the custom Lambda SDK to run.
- Wasmer Edge **lets you reuse the same architecture to deploy your static assets and your dynamic websites**, while Amazon Lambda focuses only on the dynamic requests and recommends using S3 for your static assets.
- Wasmer Edge can run UDP and other protocols while Amazon Lambda can not.
- Amazon Lambda currently has more trigger options than Wasmer Edge
