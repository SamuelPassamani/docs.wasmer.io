# PlanetScale and Wasmer Edge: Quick Start

PlanetScale is a serverless MySQL-compatible database.
It now supports read replicas so you can perform low-latency reads wherever your users are located.

This guide will help you set up PlanetScale with Wasmer Edge apps.

<Steps>

### Create a Database

[Sign in to PlanetScale](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-in), cand create an account if needed. Note that free accounts are no longer available. You can choose from Scaler, Team, or Enterprise [plans](https://planetscale.com/pricing) which include read-only regions.

Click the 'New database' button and select 'Create new database'.
Name your database and choose a region close to your app deployment for best performance.

PlanetScale will create an initial `main` branch for your schema. Wait for the initialization to complete.

![DB Summary](/edge/integrations/planetscale/db-summary.png)

Click the Connect button to view your database credentials. Choose the Node.js connection string for this guide. Note this connection string as it will only be shown once.

### Connect to Your Database

![DB Summary](/edge/integrations/planetscale/connect-db.png)

Use an SQL client like [ArcType](https://arctype.com/) or any standard MySQL client. For this guide, we'll use the MySQL option.

![Credentials](/edge/integrations/planetscale/credentials.png)

Create a new connection in your SQL client, using the connection string noted earlier. Test the connection and save it if successful.

### Create a Table and Insert Data

Open a new query in your SQL client and run the following SQL to create a table:

![Query](/edge/integrations/planetscale/query.png)

```sql copy
CREATE TABLE `fruits` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
```

You should see it succeeded:

```
CREATE succeeded (0 rows affected)
```

Add a few rows to that table:

```
INSERT INTO `fruits` (id, name) VALUES  (1, 'banana');
INSERT INTO `fruits` (id, name) VALUES  (2, 'apple');
INSERT INTO `fruits` (id, name) VALUES  (3, 'strawberry');
```

### Promote to Production

Promote the `main` branch to production for high availability and automatic backups. This can be done in the PlanetScale UI by clicking the promote button.

![Promote prod](/edge/integrations/planetscale/promote-prod.png)

You can now add read-only regions to improve performance. Select the production branch and click on Add region.

![Summary Region](/edge/integrations/planetscale/summary-region.png)

Choose the desired region and wait for the replication process to complete.

![Add Region](/edge/integrations/planetscale/add-region.png)

Each region will have unique credentials. Create a connection string for each region:

```
mysql://username:password@host/database-name?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}
```

![Finalize](/edge/integrations/planetscale/finalize.png)

Your database is now ready to be queried by your app!
