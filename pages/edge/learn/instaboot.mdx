# InstaBoot - Fast Application Startup with Snapshots

Wasmer Edge has a special feature that can significantly decrease cold start
times for your WebAssembly applications. This feature is called `InstaBoot`.

It works by pre-warming your application with a set of HTTP requests, and
then creating a snapshot. When new requests come to Edge, the app will be
restored from the snapshot instead of starting from scratch.

How useful InstaBoot is depends on the programming language and the
amount of startup logic. See below for more information on when to use InstaBoot.

## How to use InstaBoot

Here is a quick guide on how to make your applications start faster:

Modify your `app.yaml` configuration to include the following:

```yaml
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
source: ...
# ...
capabilities:
  # Enable InstaBoot:
  instaboot:
    # We provide a list of HTTP requests that will be used to pre-warm the
    # application.
    # These endpoints should make sure that the most important and expensive
    # parts of the application are loaded, caches are pre-populated, ...
    requests:
      # Load the homepage
      - path: /
      # Hit a special endpoint that makes sure caches are populated ...
      - path: /_bootstrap
      	# Optionally specify the request method and body.
        method: POST
	body: "{\"warmup\": true}"
```

That's it!

Once you deploy your application again with `wasmer deploy`, Edge will
automatically prepare a snapshot of your application, which will be used to start
the app.

**Note**:

Specifying specific requests is optional. 
You can also just specify `instaboot: {}`. Edge will then only send a single
warmup request to `/`. You should usuallyy specify specific requests though.

## When to use InstaBoot

The effectiveness of InstaBoot depends on the programming language of the app,
and if the app has expensive startup logic.

For a basic Rust webserver that just opens a socket and has no other startup
logic, InstaBoot will not make a difference.

But for some languages like `PHP` or `Python`, which need to load and
prepare code at runtime, it can make a very significant difference.

You might also have more expensive startup code, like loading translations from
a database, or populating caches. InstaBoot can help here as well.

In general, InstaBoot probably makes sense for most interpreted languages
(PHP, Python, JavaScript, ...).

Good use cases:

* Any PHP application
  PHP uses OpCache to cache pre-compiled PHP code. This makes a *very big*
  difference for performance.
  For PHP you will always want to enable InstaBoot, and make sure the warmup
  requests cover important endpoints.
* Python
  Like PHP, Python will also have to load code at runtime and prepare it for
  execution. While the difference is not quite as stark as with PHP, the speedup
  can still be very significant.
* Expensive cache warmup
* Loading translations from a database
* ...

## How it works

As a user you do not have to worry about the details of how InstaBoot works. It
will just magically speed up your application cold start times.

If you are curious, here is a brief overview:

* When Edge receives a request, it will check if there is a snapshot available
  for the application.
* If no snapshot is available, a new instance of the application will be started
  and the initialization requests are sent to the instance.
* After the warmup requests succeed, a snapshot of the application will be
  created.
* The snapshot is stored in a cache, and can be distributed across the whole
  Edge cluster to prevent redundant re-initialization on each separate server.
* For subsequent requests, the snapshot will be used to restore the application
  to the state it was in after the warmup requests succeeded.

To not impact cold start times if no snapshot is available yet,
the application will actually be started normally to serve the request immediately.
The snapshot will be created in a background task.
