### Managing secrets related to an app (`wasmer app secrets`)
You can manage secure environment variables - from now on simply _secret_ - tied to your
apps with the `wasmer app secrets` subcommand. 

```sh
$ wasmer app secrets
... 

Commands:
  create  Create a new secret related to an Edge app
  delete  Delete an existing secret related to an Edge app
  reveal  Reveal the value of an existing secret related to an Edge app
  list    Retrieve the value of an existing secret related to an Edge app
  update  Update an existing secret related to an Edge app
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

#### Creating secrets
The `wasmer app secrets create` command allows you to create a new secret for
your app. The command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie
your secrets to from simply executing the command in a directory with an
`app.yaml` configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir`
flags to specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

You can specify the name and value of the secret directly as arguments of the
CLI command: 
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets create MY_NEW_SECRET "its value"
Succesfully created secret(s):
MY_NEW_SECRET
```

If you want to create multiple secrets in bulk, the subcommand offers the 
`--from-file` flag that allows you to specify a `.env`-like file from which 
secrets are read off: 
```sh 
$ cat .env
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"

$ wasmer app secrets create --from-file=.env         
Succesfully created secret(s):
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
```

#### Listing secrets
The `wasmer app secrets list` command allows you to list - but not reveal - all
the secrets tied to your app and when they were last updated. The command is
able to automatically infer which app you want to tie your secrets to from
simply executing the command in a directory with an `app.yaml` configuration
file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir` flags to specify the app to
tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

```sh
$ wasmer app secrets list        
 Name                   Last updated      
 MY_NEW_SECRET          11m 59s ago 
 QUOTH_THE_RAVEN        3m 34s ago  
 AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN  3m 34s ago  
```

#### Revealing secrets 
The `wasmer app secrets reveal` command allows you to reveal a secret. The
command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie your secrets
to from simply executing the command in a directory with an `app.yaml`
configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir` flags to
specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

```sh
$ wasmer app secrets reveal QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
NEVERMORE
```

If you want to reveal all the secrets tied to the selected app, use the `--all` flag:
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets reveal --all                  
MY_NEW_SECRET="its value"
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"
```

#### Updating secrets 
The `wasmer app secrets update` command allows you to update an existing secret for
your app. The command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie
your secrets to from simply executing the command in a directory with an
`app.yaml` configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir`
flags to specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

You can specify the name and value of the secret directly as arguments of the
CLI command: 
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets update QUOTH_THE_RAVEN "*nevermore*"
Succesfully updated secret(s):
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
```

If you want to update multiple secrets in bulk, the subcommand offers the 
`--from-file` flag that allows you to specify a `.env`-like file from which 
secrets are read off: 
```sh 
$ cat .env
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="*nevermore*"
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="*neeeevermoreee!*"

$ wasmer app secrets create --from-file=.env         
Succesfully created secret(s):
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
```

#### Deleting secrets 
The `wasmer app secrets delete` command allows you to delete an existing secret for
your app. The command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie
your secrets to from simply executing the command in a directory with an
`app.yaml` configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir`
flags to specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

<Callout type='warning'>
Warning: once deleted, secrets cannot be recovered. 
</Callout>

You can specify the name of the secret directly as arguments of the
CLI command. In order to avoid users inadvertedly delete a secret, by default 
the command asks the user for confirmation:
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets delete QUOTH_THE_RAVEN 
✔ Delete secret 'QUOTH_THE_RAVEN'? · yes
Correctly deleted secret 'QUOTH_THE_RAVEN'
```

To stop the CLI from asking you safety confirmations, just use the `--force` flag: 
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets delete AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN --force
Correctly deleted secret 'AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN'
```

If you don't need any of your secrets anymore and want to delete all 
the secrets tied to the selected app, you can use the `--all` flag. This command will 
ask the user confirmation before deleting each secret, one by one. 
If you are completely sure of deleting all your secrets, you can combine the `--all` flag 
with the `--force` flag.
