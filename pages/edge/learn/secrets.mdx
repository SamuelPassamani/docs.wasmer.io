### Managing app secrets
You can manage secure environment variables - from now on simply _secrets_ -
tied to your apps in two ways: using the Wasmer CLI or directly from the
dashboard of your app on the [wasmer.io](https://wasmer.io) website.

We designed both these mechanisms to be secure, intuitive and accomodating.

##### From the app dashboard 
Once reached the dashboard of the app you want to add secrets to, simply click
on _Settings_ and then select the _Secrets_ tab. From that page, you can see
the dedicated button used to create a new secret. 

If you have a `.env`-like file defining your secrets and you want to tie them
to your app in bulk, you can directly upload that file using the dedicated
button.

### Creating secrets
There is two ways to create secrets:

##### From the CLI
The `wasmer app secrets create` command allows you to create a new secret for
your app. The command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie
your secrets to from simply executing the command in a directory with an
`app.yaml` configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir`
flags to specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

You can specify the name and value of the secret directly as arguments of the
CLI command: 
```bash copy
wasmer app secrets create MY_NEW_SECRET "its value"
```

Expect something like:
```
Succesfully created secret(s):
MY_NEW_SECRET
```

If you want to create multiple secrets in bulk, the subcommand offers the 
`--from-file` flag that allows you to specify a `.env`-like file from which 
secrets are read off: 
```bash
$ cat .env
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"

$ wasmer app secrets create --from-file=.env         
Succesfully created secret(s):
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
```

#### Listing secrets
There is two ways of listing secrets:

##### From the app dashboard 
Once reached the dashboard of the app you want to list secrets of, simply
click on _Settings_ and then select the _Secrets_ tab. In that page, you can
immediately see the list of secrets tied to your app. 

<ImageLoader
  img={ListSecrets}
  alt={"The wasmer.io fragment used to list secrets"}
  className="bg-[#111111] rounded-lg p-4 dark:bg-transparent"
/>

It's important to notice that by default the secrets' values are not shown,
users must instead click on the eye-like button.

##### From the CLI
The `wasmer app secrets list` command allows you to list - but not reveal - all
the secrets tied to your app and when they were last updated. The command is
able to automatically infer which app you want to tie your secrets to from
simply executing the command in a directory with an `app.yaml` configuration
file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir` flags to specify the app to
tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

```bash
$wasmer app secrets list        
 Name                   Last updated      
 MY_NEW_SECRET          11m 59s ago 
 QUOTH_THE_RAVEN        3m 34s ago  
 AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN  3m 34s ago  
```

#### Revealing secrets 
##### From the app dashboard 
Once reached the dashboard of the app you want to reveal secrets of, simply
click on _Settings_ and then select the _Secrets_ tab. In that page, you can
immediately see the list of secrets tied to your app. In order to reveal one of
them, simply click on the eye-like button!

<ImageLoader
  img={RevealSecrets}
  alt={"The wasmer.io fragment used to reveal secrets"}
  className="bg-[#111111] rounded-lg p-4 dark:bg-transparent"
/>

It's important to notice that by default the secrets' values are not shown,
users must instead click on the eye-like button.

##### From the CLI
The `wasmer app secrets reveal` command allows you to reveal a secret. The
command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie your secrets
to from simply executing the command in a directory with an `app.yaml`
configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir` flags to
specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

```sh
$ wasmer app secrets reveal QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
NEVERMORE
```

If you want to reveal all the secrets tied to the selected app, use the `--all` flag:
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets reveal --all                  
MY_NEW_SECRET="its value"
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="NEVERMORE"
```

#### Updating secrets 
##### From the app dashboard 
Once reached the dashboard of the app you want to update secrets of, simply
click on _Settings_ and then select the _Secrets_ tab. In that page, you can
immediately see the list of secrets tied to your app. In order to update one,
click on the three dots and update the value. 

<ImageLoader
  img={UpdateDeleteSecrets}
  alt={"The wasmer.io fragment used to update secrets"}
  className="bg-[#111111] rounded-lg p-4 dark:bg-transparent"
/>

##### From the CLI
The `wasmer app secrets update` command allows you to update an existing secret for
your app. The command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie
your secrets to from simply executing the command in a directory with an
`app.yaml` configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir`
flags to specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 

You can specify the name and value of the secret directly as arguments of the
CLI command: 
```sh
$ wasmer app secrets update QUOTH_THE_RAVEN "*nevermore*"
Succesfully updated secret(s):
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
```

If you want to update multiple secrets in bulk, the subcommand offers the 
`--from-file` flag that allows you to specify a `.env`-like file from which 
secrets are read off: 
```sh 
$ cat .env
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="*nevermore*"
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN="*neeeevermoreee!*"

$ wasmer app secrets create --from-file=.env         
Succesfully created secret(s):
QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN
```

#### Deleting secrets 

<Callout type='warning'>
Warning: independently of the method used, once deleted secrets cannot be recovered. 
</Callout>

##### From the app dashboard 
Once reached the dashboard of the app you want to delete secrets of, simply
click on _Settings_ and then select the _Secrets_ tab. In that page, you can
immediately see the list of secrets tied to your app. In order to update one,
click on the three dots and delete the secret. 

<ImageLoader
  img={UpdateDeleteSecrets}
  alt={"The wasmer.io fragment used to delete secrets"}
  className="bg-[#111111] rounded-lg p-4 dark:bg-transparent"
/>


##### From the CLI
The `wasmer app secrets delete` command allows you to delete an existing secret for
your app. The command is able to automatically infer which app you want to tie
your secrets to from simply executing the command in a directory with an
`app.yaml` configuration file. The CLI also has the `--app` and `--app-dir`
flags to specify the app to tie secrets to directly from the command line. 


You can specify the name of the secret directly as arguments of the
CLI command. In order to avoid users inadvertedly delete a secret, by default 
the command asks the user for confirmation:
```sh
wasmer app secrets delete QUOTH_THE_RAVEN 
✔ Delete secret 'QUOTH_THE_RAVEN'? · yes
Correctly deleted secret 'QUOTH_THE_RAVEN'
```

To stop the CLI from asking you safety confirmations, just use the `--force` flag: 
```sh
wasmer app secrets delete AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN --force
Correctly deleted secret 'AGAIN_QUOTH_THE_RAVEN'
```

If you don't need any of your secrets anymore and want to delete all 
the secrets tied to the selected app, you can use the `--all` flag. This command will 
ask the user confirmation before deleting each secret, one by one. 
If you are completely sure of deleting all your secrets, you can combine the `--all` flag 
with the `--force` flag.
