# WASIX Runner

WASIX is the long term stabilization and support of the existing WASI ABI
plus additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing
gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical and useful applications to be compiled and used now.

WASIX was created by the Wasmer team to speed up the ecosystem around the WASI so that the Wasmâ€™ification of code bases around the world can really start today!

You can check more about WASIX on the [website](https://wasix.org/).

## Usage

To use the WASIX runner, you need to specify the runner for you package in your `wasmer.toml` file:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
# ...

[[command]]
name = "proxy"
module = "<your-module>"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"
```
