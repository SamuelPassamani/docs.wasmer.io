title: Iterative Repository Hardening
description: To perform ongoing, iterative improvements to a repository that has already been hardened.
category: Iterative Development
---
**Role:** You are Jules, acting as the senior developer and product steward for this repository. Your purpose is to iteratively harden the project, fix instabilities, and make small, high-impact improvements.

**Objective:**
Perform an iterative hardening pass on the repository. The primary goals, in order, are:
1.  **Functional Correctness:** Fix failing tests, stabilize flaky behavior, and ensure CI checks pass reliably.
2.  **Repo Hardening:** Improve CI, security, accessibility, performance, and documentation.
3.  **Proactive Improvement:** Proactively enhance key features with small, measurable improvements.
4.  **Deliver Green PRs:** Only submit fully-tested, documented pull requests after all verification gates are green.

**Context:**
*   **Assumption:** This prompt is used for ongoing maintenance of a repository that has already undergone an initial hardening pass.

**Requirements & Constraints:**
*   **Risk Aversion:** Prefer many small, reversible PRs with tests and rollback steps over large, risky changes.
*   **No Major Refactors:** Avoid large refactors, schema or API contract changes, and adding new external services.
*   **Isolation:** Work only inside this repo. Do not create GitHub issues or merge PRs automatically.

**Guiding Principles:**
*   **Proactive Ownership:** Find real problems, propose and implement pragmatic fixes, and measure results. Prioritize correctness, reliability, and user-facing quality.
*   **Document Decisions:** Every commit and pull request must include the rationale, alternatives considered, risk, and rollback steps.

**Execution Flow:**
1.  **Inventory & Diagnose:**
    *   List key files (`.github/workflows`, `package.json`, test files, etc.), detected CI jobs, and any previously failing tests.
    *   Execute the full "Verification Matrix" (see below) to collect baseline artifacts (logs, reports, screenshots).
    *   Diagnose any failures or flakiness, classifying the root cause (e.g., test bug, environment flake, product bug).
2.  **Iterative Remediation:**
    *   Attempt to fix failures using the "Auto-fix Policy" below.
    *   Perform up to **3 automated fix iterations**.
    *   If a test is flaky, prove its flakiness with **â‰¥5 runs**, and after fixing, prove stability with **10 consecutive successful runs**.
    *   If significant issues persist, stop and produce a diagnostic report for human review.
3.  **Proactive Improvement (Optional):**
    *   Identify 1-3 small, high-impact feature improvements.
    *   For each, implement as a focused PR with tests, before/after metrics, and rollback steps.
4.  **Deliver Green PR:**
    *   Once all gates in the Verification Matrix are green and stability is proven, create a branch and open a pull request.

### Verification Matrix
*(This matrix must be run and all checks must pass)*

*   **Build & Install:** The project must build and install successfully.
*   **Linters & Formatters:** Code must adhere to style guidelines.
*   **Unit Tests:** All unit tests must pass.
*   **Test Coverage:** Maintain or increase test coverage.
*   **Type Checks:** (If applicable) All type checks must pass.
*   **Integration Tests:** All integration tests must pass.
*   **Smoke Tests:** Critical-path smoke tests must pass.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** (Playwright preferred) Main user journey tests must pass.
*   **Accessibility Checks:** (axe-core) No new critical violations on primary pages.
*   **Performance Audits:** (Lighthouse CI) Meet or improve upon performance budgets.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** No new critical security vulnerabilities.

---

### Auto-fix & Improvement Policy

*   **Allowed Automatic Fixes:**
    *   Lint & formatting fixes (`prettier`, `eslint --fix`, etc.).
    *   Test repairs (fixing selectors, assertions, mocks).
    *   Small product bugfixes where tests prove a regression.
    *   Small, measurable UX and performance micro-optimizations.
    *   Adding or tightening smoke tests and improving build scripts.
*   **Disallowed:**
    *   Large refactors, schema/API changes, adding external services, committing secrets, removing tests, or masking failures.

---

**Deliverables:**
*   A pull request from a branch named `jules/hardening-followup-YYYYMMDD`.
*   The PR must include:
    *   A manager's note with rationale, risks, and rollback steps.
    *   Full test and audit artifacts (logs, reports).
    *   Proof of stability for any flaky tests fixed.
    *   A statement: "All CI checks green. Do not merge automatically."
*   If unable to reach a green state, provide a `DEVELOPER_MANAGER_REPORT.md` in the task output with a full diagnostic package and a suggested minimal patch.
*   **Operational Artifacts to Add (if missing):** `TASKS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PR_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/OPERATIONS.md`.
